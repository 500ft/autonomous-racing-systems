"""LiDAR-mast hand calculation — analytical baseline for the item-16 FEA.

Models the LiDAR mast (item 15 / item 16 of the design package) as a
thin-walled cantilever tube, fixed at the deck (root) with the LiDAR mass
lumped at the free tip. Computes, for two load cases, the root bending
moment, peak bending stress, tip deflection, and yield safety factor, plus
the load-independent first natural frequency (Rayleigh tip-mass model).

This is the ANALYTICAL GROUND TRUTH that the static FEA in
docs/design/16_mechanical_design_analysis.md (Section 4) must reproduce
within ~10-15% (away from stress concentrations) before the
detailed-geometry FEA is trusted.

Units: strict SI throughout (m, kg, s, N, Pa). Printed values are converted
to engineering units (mm, MPa, Hz) only at the print boundary. numpy + stdlib
only; no FEA dependencies.

Run:
    python experiments/mast_hand_calc.py
Output is also written to runs/mast_hand_calc/summary.txt.

# --- Geometry (ASSUMED) ---
# Short mast so the optical center clears the chassis/compute stack without a
# tall, whippy cantilever. 0.12 m is a typical sensor-deck-to-optical-center
# height for a 1/10-scale car; the moment arm h_arm == L here because the tip
# mass sits at the free end (conservative: full length is the lever).

# Common, weldable, cheap stock tube; properties are textbook handbook values.
# Carbon-fiber tube is the lighter, stiffer alternative (E roughly 70-130 GPa
# axial depending on layup, rho roughly 1600 kg/m^3) but is anisotropic and
# has no single sigma_yield; aluminum is the conservative, well-defined choice
# for a hand-calc baseline. See note printed at the end.

# The mast tip mass is now firmed against the SELECTED 2D LiDAR (item 15,
# docs/design/15_sensor_compute_power.md): the Hokuyo UST-10LX, the canonical
# F1TENTH scanner. Build-up (see item 15 for the full table):
#   LiDAR body  : 0.130 kg  -- Hokuyo UST-10LX datasheet "Mass: Approx. 130 g"
#                             (Hokuyo UST-10LX/UST-20LX specification sheet;
#                              same 130 g is listed in the official F1TENTH BOM).
#   Bracket/HW  : 0.030 kg  -- ASSUMED: 3D-printed/Al L-bracket + M3 fasteners
#                             (30 g allowance; bench-typical for this sensor).
#   Cable/conn. : 0.015 kg  -- ASSUMED: pigtail Ethernet + power lead carried by
#                             the tip (15 g allowance; the run to the deck).
#   -> firmed tip mass = 0.130 + 0.030 + 0.015 = 0.175 kg
# This 0.175 kg is LIGHTER than the previous 0.20 kg placeholder, so it RAISES
# f1 (m_eff falls) and LOWERS bending stress -- a strict improvement on both
# the modal guard and the strength margin. A lighter RPLIDAR S2/A2 (~0.19 kg

# inertial load with modeling uncertainty (tip mass, section, mounting fixity),
# so a 2x margin on yield is a conventional, defensible choice.

# --- Crash/drop case (ASSUMED, justified) ---

# a transient deceleration. Rather than guess a contact stiffness / stop
# distance (which sets the true peak g and is highly uncertain), we adopt a
# stated, conservative half-sine-equivalent shock of 50 g applied to the tip
# mass. 50 g is a common ruggedized-electronics shock-survival level and
# bounds a low-speed bench drop of this small mass; it is deliberately well
# above the ~2 g maneuvering case so the crash governs the strength check.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The baseline (L=0.12 m, OD=16 mm, t=1.5 mm, 6061-T6) PASSES strength but
# FAILS the modal guard band: f1 = 163.8 Hz < 200 Hz. The sweep below searches
# mast geometry (length L, outer diameter OD, wall t) and material to find
# configurations that clear f1 >= 200 Hz with comfortable margin while keeping
# the crash-case yield safety factor acceptable.
#
# WHY shortening L and growing OD work (and why they win over adding mass):
#   k_eff = 3 E I / L^3,  I = (pi/64)(OD^4 - ID^4) ~ (pi/8) R^3 t  (thin wall)
#   f1 = (1/2pi) sqrt(k_eff / m_eff),  m_eff = m_tip + 0.23 m_mast
#   The 0.175 kg tip mass dominates m_eff (mast self-mass ~0.02 kg), so m_eff
#   is nearly constant and f1 ~ sqrt(k_eff) = sqrt(3 E I / L^3).
#     - Length:  k ∝ L^-3, so f1 ∝ L^-1.5. A 0.12 -> 0.10 m cut is a 1.73x
#       stiffness gain (1.32x in f1) for a TINY mass change.
#     - Diameter: I ∝ OD^3·t (thin wall), while the added material the larger
#       tube contributes to m_eff is second-order (tip mass dominates). So OD
#       buys stiffness far faster than it adds effective mass.
