"""Item-16 §7: mounting tolerance stack -> LiDAR scan-plane tilt -> sightline check.

The UST-10LX scans a horizontal plane. Yaw misalignment is nulled in software
by the localization mount calibration, so the physical stack that matters is
the TILT (pitch/roll) of the optical plane: stacked interface tolerances tilt
the beam, and at range the beam either climbs over the track wall (up-tilt) or
grazes the floor and returns false obstacles (down-tilt).

Requirement (derived, both directions, at the UST-10LX guaranteed range):
    up-tilt   : beam height at R_MAX must stay below the wall top
                theta <= atan((H_WALL - H_OPT) / R_MAX)
    down-tilt : the floor-graze distance must stay beyond R_MAX
                theta <= atan(H_OPT / R_MAX)
The up-tilt bound governs (wall clearance above the optical center is smaller
than the height of the optical center above the floor).

Each contributor is labelled ASSUMED where it is an engineering-typical value
rather than a datasheet/spec number, following the item-15/16 convention. The
elastic tilt under the measured 2g maneuvering load is computed from the
validated FEA deflection (runs/mast_fea/fea_summary.txt) and included to show
it is negligible against the interface tolerances.

Run:  python experiments/mast_tolerance_stack.py
Output: runs/mast_tolerance_stack/summary.txt (+ stdout). Exit 0 only if the
as-calibrated stack passes; the as-assembled (blind) stack is reported either
way.
