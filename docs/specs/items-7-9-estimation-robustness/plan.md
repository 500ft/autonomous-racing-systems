# Items 7-9 Estimation and Robustness - Implementation Plan

Historical implementation record. The [roadmap](../../../ROADMAP.md) is the
only active dependency plan; the instructions below are retained provenance.
Design: inline draft below
Status: implemented
Date: 2026-06-19

## Draft Design Header

### Scope

Implement the next simulation-side robustness block after the controller work:

- Item 7: EKF study comparing dead reckoning and EKF under noisy measurements and dropout windows.
- Item 8: failure-mode FMEA reproducing at least five failures with detection signals and mitigations.
- Item 9: parameter-identification robustness under injected noise, latency, and quantization.

### Non-Scope

- No physical RoboRacer bag requirement; item 11 covers ROS-backed or physical-bag data.
- No fabrication or CAD work; items 10 and 13-17 cover the vehicle-design package.
- No new solver dependencies unless an existing dependency cannot support the required study.

### Acceptance Criteria

| ID | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| FR-7A | Generate reproducible noisy/dropout measurements from existing Gym/controller traces. |
| FR-7B | Implement dead reckoning and EKF estimators using the shared vehicle-model utilities. |
| FR-7C | Report estimator RMSE over time and a summary table showing when EKF improves over dead reckoning. |
| FR-8A | Reproduce at least five failure modes from the current pipeline. |
| FR-8B | Record cause, trigger, observable detection signal, effect, severity, and mitigation for each failure. |
| FR-8C | Produce an FMEA report and validation script. |
| FR-9A | Re-run `C_Sf`/`C_Sr` identification under injected sensor noise, latency, and quantization. |
| FR-9B | Report coefficient error, held-out degradation, and Jacobian condition number degradation. |
| FR-9C | Identify the first perturbation level where the parameter-ID acceptance gates stop passing. |
| FR-X | Update `GitHub Review Items/README.md`, README/report links, `run_all.sh`, and validators. |

### Conventions From Current Repo

- Experiment scripts live in `experiments/`.
- Shared utilities live in `gym/roboracer/`.
- Reports live in `reports/`; figures live in `reports/figures/`.
- Result artifacts live in `runs/<experiment_name>/`.
- Validation scripts are named `experiments/validate_<experiment_name>.py`.
- Scripts should add `gym/` to `sys.path` the same way current controller and SysID scripts do.
- Heavy studies should be gated in `run_all.sh` with an environment flag.

## Tasks

### [x] T00 - Record baseline commands
- Files: `docs/specs/items-7-9-estimation-robustness/plan.md`
- Do: run and record these commands under Execution notes:
  - `env PYTHONPATH=gym python -m compileall -q gym/roboracer experiments`
  - `env PYTHONPATH=gym python experiments/validate_controller_comparison.py`
  - `env PYTHONPATH=gym python experiments/validate_dynamic_parameter_identification.py`
- Depends on: none
- Done when: commands are recorded with pass/fail status.
- Parallel group: setup

### [x] T01 - Add shared measurement-noise helpers
- Files: `gym/roboracer/noise.py` (new)
- Do: implement:
  - `@dataclass class NoiseSpec`
  - `@dataclass class DropoutWindow`
  - `def make_rng(seed: int) -> np.random.Generator`
  - `def apply_sensor_noise(frame: pd.DataFrame, spec: NoiseSpec, *, seed: int) -> pd.DataFrame`
  - `def apply_dropout_windows(frame: pd.DataFrame, windows: list[DropoutWindow]) -> pd.DataFrame`
  - `def apply_quantization(frame: pd.DataFrame, steps: dict[str, float]) -> pd.DataFrame`
  These functions must preserve original ground-truth columns and add noisy measurement columns with a `meas_` prefix.
- Depends on: T00
- Done when: module imports with `from roboracer.noise import NoiseSpec`.
- Parallel group: A

### [x] T02 - Add measurement-noise unit validator
- Files: `experiments/validate_noise_helpers.py` (new)
- Do: create a deterministic smoke validator that builds a tiny DataFrame, applies noise/dropout/quantization, and asserts:
  - same row count,
  - `meas_*` columns exist,
  - dropout rows contain NaN in measurement columns only,
  - same seed gives identical noisy outputs.
- Depends on: T01
- Done when: `python experiments/validate_noise_helpers.py` prints `noise helper validation: PASS`.
- Parallel group: A

### [x] T03 - Add shared estimator models
- Files: `gym/roboracer/estimation.py` (new)
- Do: implement:
  - `def dead_reckon_step(state: np.ndarray, control: np.ndarray, dt: float, params: dict[str, float]) -> np.ndarray`
  - `class ExtendedKalmanFilter`
  - `def finite_difference_jacobian(fn, x: np.ndarray, eps: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray`
  - `def angle_residual(value: float, reference: float) -> float`
  EKF state should be `[x_m, y_m, theta_rad, speed_mps, yaw_rate_radps]`. Use existing `roboracer.dynamics.kinematic_bicycle_rk4_step` or a documented reduced model for prediction; update with position, yaw, speed, and yaw-rate measurements when present. Add explicit constructor inputs for process covariance `Q` and measurement covariance `R`; do not hardcode tuning inside the EKF class.

### [x] T04 - Add estimator smoke validator
- Files: `experiments/validate_estimation_helpers.py` (new)

  - EKF covariance stays finite and symmetric,
  - angle wrapping is bounded within `[-pi, pi]`,
  - EKF RMSE is not worse than dead reckoning on the synthetic noisy measurements.
- Depends on: T03
- Done when: `python experiments/validate_estimation_helpers.py` prints `estimation helper validation: PASS`.
- Parallel group: A

### [x] T05 - Implement EKF study runner
- Files: `experiments/ekf_study.py` (new)

  - `clean_measurements`,
  - `low_noise`,
  - `high_noise`,
  - `dropout_1s`,
  - `dropout_3s`.
  For each scenario, run dead reckoning and EKF against Gym ground truth, write per-timestep errors and summary metrics.
  Set measurement covariance `R` from the known injected `NoiseSpec` values for each scenario. Set process covariance `Q` from a documented model-uncertainty table in the script, not by hand-tuning per scenario. Record both `Q` and `R` in metadata.

- Parallel group: D

### [x] T15 - Refactor parameter fitting for robustness reuse
- Files: `gym/roboracer/identification.py`, `experiments/fit_dynamic_parameters.py`

## Traceability

| Requirement | Tasks |
| --- | --- |
| FR-7A | T01, T02, T05 |
| FR-7B | T03, T04, T05 |
| FR-7C | T06, T07, T08 |
| FR-8A | T09, T10, T13 |
| FR-8B | T11, T12, T13 |
| FR-8C | T12, T13 |
| FR-9A | T14, T15, T16, T17 |
| FR-9B | T18, T19, T20, T21 |
| FR-9C | T18, T20, T21 |
| FR-X | T22, T23, T24, T25, T26, T27, T28 |

## Execution Notes

- Recommended order: complete shared helpers first (`T01`-`T04`), then run item 7 (`T05`-`T08`), item 8 (`T09`-`T13`), item 9 (`T14`-`T21`), then integration tasks (`T22`-`T28`).
- Parallelizable groups after setup:
  - Group B: EKF study tasks after shared helpers.
  - Group C: FMEA tasks after failure definitions and EKF noise/dropout traces exist; this group is not independent of Group B because `T10` depends on `T05`.
  - Group D: parameter-ID robustness after fitting refactor and noise helpers.
- Risk: T15 touches the existing accepted parameter-ID pipeline. Preserve current CLI outputs first, then add robustness reuse.
- Risk: EKF can be made to look artificially good if it updates on ground truth. Measurements must use `meas_*` degraded columns; metrics must compare estimates against original ground-truth columns.
- Risk: EKF results are dominated by `Q` and `R`. Set `R` mechanically from injected measurement noise and record the fixed `Q` model-uncertainty table in metadata before looking at results.
- Risk: if high perturbation levels do not fail acceptance gates, report degradation trends honestly and add a stronger `combined_high` perturbation only if it is documented in metadata.
- Implementation note: the reusable identification contract lives in `gym/roboracer/identification.py`, not under `experiments/`, because experiment scripts are not importable as a package under the repo's current run pattern.
