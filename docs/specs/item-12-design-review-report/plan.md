# Item 12 Design-Review Report - Execution Plan

Historical implementation record. The [roadmap](../../../ROADMAP.md) is the
only active dependency plan; the instructions below are retained provenance.

Status: done

- [x] Inventory post-pull report markers and classify Node 10 scope.
  Evidence: `rg -n -i 'TODO|\[confirm\]|TBD' docs reports`.
- [x] Map the mechanical proof chain and physical gate to committed sources.
  Evidence: hand-calc, FEA, convergence, design-package, and frozen-protocol
  artifacts inspected on commit `bd619d7`.
- [x] Add executable report-build and number-to-source traceability tests.
  Evidence: `python experiments/test_final_report.py` passes six closure tests.
- [x] Commit the deterministic tolerance-stack run output that the report cites.
  Evidence: `python experiments/mast_tolerance_stack.py` writes the checked
  `runs/mast_tolerance_stack/summary.txt`.
- [x] Replace the final-report outline with the review-ready source.
  Evidence: source has 12 review sections, a requirements matrix, evidence
  labels, and zero unresolved report markers.
- [x] Build and visually inspect the 10-20 page PDF.
  Evidence: `python scripts/build_final_report.py` produces a 15-page PDF;
  every rendered page was inspected for clipping, overlap, and legibility.
- [x] Run report build, traceability, evidence tests, and full diff review.
  Evidence: all five evidence/closure commands pass; `py_compile`,
  unresolved-marker inventory, and `git diff --check` pass.
- [x] Record the closing commit and push it to `origin/main`.
  Evidence: this plan is included in the closing commit on `origin/main`.
