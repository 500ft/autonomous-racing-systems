# RoboRacer sprint review index — software candidate, partial project handoff

## Week of 2026-09-19 — reviewer packet

The canonical entry point for this week is [`evidence/week-2026-09-19/README.md`](../evidence/week-2026-09-19/README.md),
with a hash manifest verifiable by `python3 scripts/build_week_manifest.py --verify`. **Ready for review,
not reviewed.** No physical measurement, calibration, host run or campaign took place.

Delivered: equipment inventory, acquisition format and host logger with replay, load-cell calibration
tooling, the W3.2 decision screen and three input requests, a prospective compliance-adequacy proposal
(unapproved), a three-case modal attachment study, and a scoped
[W1.8 nominal report](W1_8_NOMINAL_REPORT.md).

Two findings a reviewer should not miss: a passing median R² is not campaign reliability (at 0.3 µm
assumed repeatability about one single-axis campaign in seven is still rejected), and both frozen
numerical gates can pass while an uncorrected load-proportional root rotation leaves the fitted
compliance 19.4 % wrong. Root-motion observability is a correctness requirement, not a refinement.

All physical gates remain blocked: RR-CAD-02/04/05/06/07, RR-S02, RR-S09, RR-S12, RR-S13.

## Day-3 preparation — 2026-09-09

Six request-sheet tests cover exact pending-row coverage, future rows, invalid units, a filled pending value, duplicates and snapshot drift. 28 CAD tests pass. The failed 174.7 Hz baseline is distinguished from the selected nominal 285.5 Hz FE result; static acceptance is not repurposed as a modal verdict.

Review [DAY3_PLAN.md](DAY3_PLAN.md), [deliverable](../cad/roboracer/fixture-preparation.md), and [commands/evidence](../evidence/task-day3-2026-09-09/README.md). Base: `44491a62d4418294d14143466c757010b1694ba4`; new PR branch: `task/day-three-20260909`. No original Owner/External gate is closed. Final source identity is the PR head, reported in its delivery record rather than embedded circularly here.

As-built dimensions, calibrated uncertainty and pre-load reference freeze still required.

## Hosted tooling acceptance — 2026-09-09

RR-CAD-08 is now **done**: hosted geometry and existing CI passed for source
`8cefd74f15af71f95125d4fc15f62331d52ee795`. The uploaded STEP was downloaded, hash-checked,
reimported and checked for one solid and contracted volume. See
[hosted checks and artifact identity](../evidence/review-2026-09-09/hosted-verification.json). This supersedes the
intermediate in-progress statements below. Owner/physical gates remain open.


## Latest follow-up — 2026-09-09

[Day-2 adversarial review](../evidence/review-2026-09-09/README.md) supersedes
the initial completion claim below: RR-CAD-08 is in progress until the installed
geometry workflow runs green. The original patch-only delivery did not meet its
CI acceptance criterion. Input admission, full direct-package version checking,
and STEP round-trip metric checks are hardened with reproduced regressions.

[RR-CAD-08 geometry-tooling handoff](../evidence/task-2026-09-09/README.md) adds a parameter-driven
CadQuery generator, a reviewed geometry contract with 11 fail-closed tests, and a pinned
toolchain. It regenerates model geometry from the register; it is not a fixture design, part or
measurement. Geometry CI awaits the owner applying `ci-proposed/cad-geometry-workflow.patch`.

## Follow-up — 2026-09-08

[RR-CAD-01 input-register handoff](../evidence/task-2026-09-08/README.md) completes
one planning-input task, not a CAD model. Hardware/metrology owner gates remain
open. Earlier sprint evidence below is historical and unchanged.

Updated 2026-09-06. [Roadmap](SPRINT_ROADMAP.md), [authoritative ledger](SPRINT_TASKS.csv),

## Identity and scope

Canonical worktree `/Users/redhose/Developer/research-sprints/2026-09-05/RoboRacer`;
remote `https://github.com/500ft/RoboRacer.git`; branch
`sprint/evidence-integrity-20260905`; base
`bea803741ab91c8d1e782064666d97f302dbb9d9`; final commit is this packet's
containing commit (reported in the PR; not self-embedded).
[Candidate/source SHA-256 inventory](../evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/candidate.json)
identifies the exact evaluator, regression fixture generator, protocol and
public status corrections. No release, deployment, or container build occurred.
The delivery route is the repository's Python CLI, exercised as a consumer
subprocess—not a published package. Original checkout is untouched.

## Deliverables and evidence

| Deliverable | Acceptance evidence |
|---|---|
| Reproduced original false validation | [Complete baseline input/output](../evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/baseline.md); [25 failing subcases before correction](../evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/red-matrix.log) |
| Complete matrix/numeric validity and per-axis comparison | [Evaluator](../experiments/mast_physical_validation.py), [20 regression tests](../experiments/test_mast_physical_validation.py), [green checks](../evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/green-portable.log) |
| Campaign/reference identity and honest synthetic labels | [Two red provenance regressions](../evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/red-provenance.log), [schema and CLI contract](specs/mast-physical-validation/design.md) |
| Consumer CLI and boundary behavior | [Six complete CLI outputs and input hashes](../evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/evaluation-results.json); [selection, prior judgments and limitations](../evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/evaluation.md) |
| Consistent conditional physical scope | [Mechanical status](design/16_mechanical_design_analysis.md), [Owner readiness checklist](specs/mast-physical-validation/campaign-readiness.md), [test report](specs/mast-physical-validation/test-report.md) |

The original incomplete four-row input now raises a controlled input error,
not `VALIDATED`. A complete dataset without a campaign is `INCONCLUSIVE`, with
no nominal reference passed off as as-built FEA. Checked synthetic agreement
is `SIMULATED_AGREEMENT`; the physical `VALIDATED` branch is tested only using
**mocked Git history and synthetic test input**, not physical measurements.

## Reproduce

The primary agent independently reran the delegated software checks on2026-09-06:
[actual rerun record](../evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/parent-verification.json).
This is additional software verification, not independent human or physical validation.

From the worktree root (observed exits all 0 unless stated):

```bash
python -m py_compile experiments/mast_physical_validation.py experiments/test_mast_physical_validation.py
git diff --check
PYTHONPATH=gym python experiments/test_rosbag_to_telemetry.py
PYTHONPATH=gym python experiments/test_bag_evidence.py
PYTHONPATH=gym python experiments/validate_item11.py
PYTHONPATH=gym python experiments/test_mast_physical_validation.py
PYTHONPATH=gym python experiments/test_final_report.py
python evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/evaluate_candidate.py
```

The five portable CI checks pass locally; mast tests 20, report tests 6.
Evaluation runner exits 0 after comparing actual CLI outcomes to all six
predeclared judgments: E1/E2/E5 simulated agreement, E4 inconclusive, E3/E6
input error **exit 2**. Full original stdout/stderr and statuses are retained.
The runner refuses changed candidate hashes. A rerun uses new temporary
paths, not new inputs. No post-evaluation source fixes occurred.

Local runtime is Python 3.11.8 macOS arm64 with versions recorded in progress;
it is not CI's pinned Python 3.10 or Docker environment. No typechecker or
linter is configured; compile/whitespace checks supplement the existing
tests. Full legacy Gym regeneration, Docker image build/run and physical
campaigns were not executed. Do not interpret portable success as those results.

### Intentional API/CLI changes

- CLI now requires `--campaign`; old bare CSV/`--relative-u95` invocation exits
  2 and points to the missing argument. Optional `--relative-u95` must match
  the campaign uncertainty record; it cannot replace that evidence.
- Python `evaluate_rows(rows, relative_u95, campaign=None)` remains callable
  without provenance for inspection, but cannot return validation. Supplied
  campaigns must load through `load_campaign` and are rechecked at evaluation.
- Invalid/non-finite/incomplete inputs raise `ValueError` or a controlled CLI
  error rather than being fitted. Undefined R²/hysteresis is JSON null, never
  a nonstandard Infinity/NaN result. Numerical thresholds are unchanged.
- Optional CSV `load_level_n` records nominal targets separately from measured
  force. Exact target forces retain six-column compatibility. All valid CLI
  analyses exit 0, even inconclusive/discrepant; inspect classification.

## Evaluation meaning and incomplete work

All evaluation inputs are synthetic, developer-selected and related to the
development requirements. Six matches demonstrate these cases, not general
accuracy, independent validation or real mast stiffness. Checksums prove file
identity, not truthful measurement or scientifically adequate uncertainty.

Remaining priorities (no external action represented as completed):

1. **RR-S02 blocked:** Owner supplies approved fixture/instruments, calibration,
   as-built CAD/inspection and FEA plus actual campaign records before physical
   use. Human review must assess boundary conditions, fixture rotation, zero
   checks and uncertainty propagation; file presence alone cannot do that.
2. **RR-S09 blocked:** Owner nominates/authorizes an independent reviewer; no
   outreach sent and no feedback received. Pinned Docker/legacy regeneration
   remains an explicit unexecuted follow-up if deployment there is required.
3. **RR-2 deferred:** independently challenged controls results (changed plant,
   friction, speed/delay/observability) are outside this integrity sprint.

Résumé/project wording supported now: “Hardened a LiDAR-mast compliance
analysis workflow to enforce complete paired experiments and traceable
references, with reproducible adversarial checks separating simulation from
physical validation.” Do not add a measured-compliance or impact-survival claim.

## Ready-to-send review request — not sent

“Review RoboRacer against docs/SPRINT_ROADMAP.md. Repository: /Users/redhose/Developer/research-sprints/2026-09-05/RoboRacer. Base commit: bea803741ab91c8d1e782064666d97f302dbb9d9. Final commit: PR head (see GitHub PR). Review index: docs/REVIEW_READY.md. Incomplete work: Owner-confirmed physical readiness and actual measurements; independent review; pinned Docker/legacy-environment verification. Reproduce the changed behaviors and counterexamples, rerun appropriate checks, and assess the code and evidence independently. Review first; make further changes only if requested.”
