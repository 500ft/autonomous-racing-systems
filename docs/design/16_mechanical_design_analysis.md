# 16 — Mechanical Design and Analysis (CAD / FEA Centerpiece)

**Status: model-based design study; no fabricated or measured mast.** The completed LiDAR-mast calculations/FEA use the firmed item-15 tip mass (Hokuyo UST-10LX datasheet body 130 g → installed tip mass 0.175 kg) and idealized tube geometry. Reported hand/FEA agreement is model-to-model verification, not physical validation. Parametric mast/deck CAD and as-built dimensions remain pending. The July 17 [physical protocol](../specs/mast-physical-validation/design.md) is a conditional next stage, gated on Owner-confirmed fabrication, inspection, calibrated instrumentation and as-built FEA; this sprint supplies analysis integrity, not hardware. It supersedes the old unconditional “design-only: no fabrication” scope without claiming fabrication is authorized or complete. See the [sprint roadmap](../SPRINT_ROADMAP.md) and [readiness checklist](../specs/mast-physical-validation/campaign-readiness.md).

**Model baseline retained:** the 0.175 kg tip mass replaces the old 0.20 kg placeholder, raising modeled frequency margin and strength SF. Items 13–15 informed the July 7 mass budget (≈4.42 kg against ≤4.5 kg) and component selections; manufacturing tolerances and per-component CG locations still require CAD/inspection. This status correction does not regenerate those model results.

**Dependency order — do NOT do FEA first.** This file is **last**: **13 → 14 → 15 → 16**. The FEA must run on the **real geometry** locked in item 14 (wheelbase 0.3302 m, deck layout) and the **real masses** chosen in item 15 (LiDAR mass + optical-center height, compute, battery). An FEA built before those exist would be analyzing a fictional part. Do not start the mesh until items 13-15 are filled.

**Load-case philosophy — replace the placeholder 4g.** The old item-10 spec used an arbitrary **4g** load. **Do not use 4g.** The governing *maneuvering* case is **derived from this project's own telemetry**:

```
F_lateral, governing = m_LiDAR_tip × a_lat,peak × SF
```

where `a_lat,peak` is the **measured peak lateral acceleration** from the ride-quality race metrics added in commit `9e603d0` — `max_abs_lat_accel_mps2` from `summarize_run` / `race_and_report` in `gym/roboracer/closed_loop.py` — `m_LiDAR_tip` is the LiDAR tip mass from item 15, and `SF` is a stated safety factor. A **separate crash / drop case** is analyzed independently (it is not a steady maneuvering load and should not be blended into the maneuvering case).

> **Peak lateral acceleration — measured from a clean completed lap.** `a_lat,peak = 19.4 m/s²` (≈ 2.0 g), the `max_abs_lat_accel_mps2` reported by `summarize_run` for a **clean completed lap** (`completed_lap == True`, `collision == False`) of the **tuned pure-pursuit baseline** (lookahead 1.2 m, velocity gain 1.2 — the single `selected_baseline == True` row in `runs/pure_pursuit_sweep/results.csv`). Conditions: **RK4 integrator, `dt = 0.002 s`, controller at 100 Hz**, `examples/example_map`; lap time 38.04 s, mean speed 8.33 m/s. Companion figures from the same lap: `mean_abs_lat_accel_mps2 = 5.78`, `max_abs_long_accel_mps2 = 9.51`, `rms_lat_jerk_mps3 = 22.1`. Reproduce with `experiments/ride_quality_baseline.py`; the run is committed to `runs/ride_quality_baseline/` (`summary.json` + per-step `telemetry.csv`). The discarded `runs/first_lap/telemetry.csv` figures (max |a_y| ≈ 78 m/s², max |a_x| ≈ 801 m/s²) are **raw scripted-lap / collision spikes** and were deliberately **not** used.

## 2. Mass and CG Budget — masses LOCKED (2026-07-07); CG locations = CAD deliverable

> Masses are locked from the item-14/15 part selections (vendor/datasheet where published, **ASSUMED** where stated). Per-component CG coordinates (x, y, z) are the **first output of the parametric CAD** (next work item): they require the deck layout — which must also place the R-14 transponder bay (≥ 8 × 12 cm, front half, clear above) — so they are deliberately not guessed here. Total mass traces to R-11.

| Item | Mass (kg) | Basis |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Rolling chassis, TRA68086-4 as shipped (incl. motor, stock ESC, servo, body) | 2.640 | vendor spec (93.1 oz) |
| − body shell + spoiler (removed) | −0.150 | **ASSUMED** — weigh at teardown |
| − stock VXL-3s ESC + receiver (removed) | −0.090 | **ASSUMED** — weigh at teardown |
| + VESC 6 MkVI | +0.120 | **ASSUMED** — vendor publishes dims (75×70×18 mm) but not mass; weigh on receipt |
| + platform deck + standoffs | +0.300 | **ASSUMED** — laser-cut plate per the standard build; CAD replaces with exact material volume |
| + LiDAR mast (recommended geometry, §3.2) | +0.024 | hand calc (23.5 g; L=100 mm, OD=20 mm, t=1.5 mm, 6061-T6) |
| + LiDAR tip package (UST-10LX + bracket + cable) | +0.175 | item 15 §1.2 (LOCKED: 0.130 datasheet + 0.045 ASSUMED allowances) |
| + Jetson Orin NX 16 GB + J401 carrier, heatsink, case | +0.450 | **ASSUMED** — assembled mass not published; weigh on receipt |
| + drive battery (Traxxas 2872X, 3S 5 000 mAh) | +0.376 | vendor spec (13.3 oz) |
| + compute battery (Traxxas 2872X) | +0.376 | vendor spec |
| + 12 V regulator + fuses + wiring harness | +0.150 | **ASSUMED** allowance |
| **Total (ready to race)** | **≈ 4.42** | sum — **within the R-11 ≤ 4.5 kg budget** (margin 0.08 kg, thin; the ASSUMED rows carry the uncertainty) |

> **Honest deviations, stated:** (1) 4.42 kg vs the identified model's `m = 3.74 kg` (**+18%**) — one more reason the sim `C_Sf`/`C_Sr` do **not** transfer to hardware (item 14 §5); the item-14 §3 tractive sizing was computed at 4.42 kg, not 3.74. (2) The model CG height `h = 0.074 m` (`dynamics.py`) will be exceeded by the real deck + mast build — quantify at CAD and check the rollover margin at the 19.4 m/s² lateral envelope then. (3) Six rows are ASSUMED; each is replaced by a scale measurement at build (item 17) or CAD volume (deck) — the budget is honest about where its ±0.1 kg-class uncertainty lives.

## 3. LiDAR Mast — Free-Body Diagram + Hand Calculation (REQUIRED)

> TEMPLATE / TODO. Required deliverable: a labeled FBD of the mast as a cantilever with the LiDAR mass at the tip, loaded by `F_lateral, governing = m_LiDAR_tip × a_lat,peak × SF` applied at the optical-center height (moment arm). Hand-calc bending stress and tip deflection from beam theory:
- Bending moment at root: `M = F_lateral × h_arm`
- Max bending stress: `σ = M·c / I`
- Tip deflection: `δ = F_lateral·L³ / (3·E·I)`

Record the section (I, c), the numbers, and the margin against σ_yield. **This hand calc is the ground truth the FEA must match.** Also run the **crash/drop case** as a separate FBD/hand calc.

> Values below are for the **recommended (frequency-fix) geometry** (§3.2; L=100 mm, OD=20 mm, t=1.5 mm 6061-T6) with the **firmed 0.175 kg** tip mass. The **crash case governs strength** (50 g) and is tabulated here; the maneuvering case (2 g) is far milder (σ ≈ 3.0 MPa). Full both-case numbers are in §3.1.

| Quantity | Symbol | Value (crash, recommended geom.) | Note |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| Governing crash force | F | **128.8 N** | = m_LiDAR_tip × 50 g × SF_crash (0.175 kg × 490 m/s² × 1.5); **a_lat,peak = 19.4 m/s² known**; m_LiDAR_tip **firmed 0.175 kg** (item 15) |
| Moment arm | h_arm | **0.100 m** | optical-center height = mast length |
| Root bending moment | M | **12.88 N·m** | F × h_arm = 128.76 N × 0.100 m (corrected 2026-09-19; 15.45 N·m belongs to the rejected 120 mm baseline in §3.1) |
| Section modulus / I, c | — | **I = 3754 mm⁴, c = 10.0 mm** | recommended OD=20 mm tube |
| Hand-calc max stress | σ_hand | **34.3 MPa** | M·c/I (crash, root) |
| Hand-calc tip deflection | δ_hand | **0.166 mm** | F·L³/(3EI) (crash) |
| Margin vs yield | — | **8.05** | σ_yield / σ_hand (crash; PASS ≥ 1.5) |

### 3.1 Hand calculation (analytical baseline)

> Closed-form baseline, re-run on the **firmed item-15 tip mass**. The mast is
> modeled as a **thin-walled 6061-T6 aluminum cantilever tube**, fixed at the
> deck (root) with the LiDAR mass lumped at the free tip (moment arm = full
> length). Reproduce with `experiments/mast_hand_calc.py`; raw output is in
> `runs/mast_hand_calc/summary.txt`. **The tip mass is now FIRMED at 0.175 kg**
> (item 15 §1.2: Hokuyo UST-10LX 0.130 kg datasheet + 0.030 kg bracket + 0.015 kg
> cable); geometry and material remain engineering choices (labelled ASSUMED).
> The measured `a_lat,peak = 19.4 m/s²` is a non-assumed input. **The firmed
> 0.175 kg is lighter than the prior 0.20 kg placeholder, so f1 rose and stress
> fell — verified below.**

**Assumptions block (all ASSUMED unless noted):**

| Parameter | Value | Basis |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Mast length `L` (= moment arm `h_arm`) | 0.120 m | ASSUMED — short mast, tip at free end (conservative lever) |
| Tube OD | 16.0 mm | ASSUMED — stock aluminum tube |
| Wall thickness `t` | 1.50 mm | ASSUMED → ID 13.0 mm |
| Section: `I` = π/64·(OD⁴−ID⁴), `c` = OD/2 | I = 1.815×10⁻⁹ m⁴ (1815 mm⁴), c = 8.0 mm | derived |
| Material | 6061-T6 Al: E = 68.9 GPa, σ_yield = 276 MPa, ρ = 2700 kg/m³ | ASSUMED — carbon tube is the lighter/stiffer alternative but anisotropic with no single yield; Al is the conservative baseline |
| Tip mass `m_tip` | **0.175 kg** | **FIRMED (item 15 §1.2)** — Hokuyo UST-10LX 0.130 kg [datasheet] + 0.030 kg bracket + 0.015 kg cable |
| Maneuver accel `a_lat,peak` | 19.4 m/s² (≈ 2.0 g) | **MEASURED** — clean lap, `runs/ride_quality_baseline` |
| Crash shock | 50 g = 490 m/s² | ASSUMED — stated half-sine-equivalent survival shock; bounds a low-speed bench drop and deliberately governs strength over the ~2 g maneuvering case |
| Safety factors | SF_maneuver = 2.0, SF_crash = 1.5 | ASSUMED — 2.0 on yield for the repeated maneuvering load; 1.5 on top of the already-inflated 50 g crash |

**Results — both load cases** (cantilever, tip point load `F = m_tip·a·SF`, fixed root):

_Baseline geometry (L=120 mm, OD=16 mm, t=1.5 mm), firmed 0.175 kg tip:_

| Quantity | Maneuvering (2 g, SF 2.0) | Crash (50 g, SF 1.5) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Tip force `F` | 6.79 N | 128.76 N |
| Root moment `M = F·L` | 0.815 N·m | 15.45 N·m |
| Max bending stress `σ = M·c/I` | 3.59 MPa | 68.10 MPa |
| Tip deflection `δ = F·L³/(3EI)` | 0.031 mm | 0.593 mm |
| Yield margin `σ_yield/σ` | **76.9** (PASS, ≥2.0) | **4.05** (PASS, ≥1.5) |

The **crash case governs strength** (σ ≈ 68 MPa vs 4 MPa); both clear yield with margin. Stress is modest because a 16 mm tube is over-stiff in bending for these loads — strength is not the binding constraint. (The firmed 0.175 kg tip lowered the crash stress from the 0.20 kg-placeholder 77.8 → 68.1 MPa, lifting the crash SF 3.55 → 4.05.)

**First natural frequency** (load-independent; Rayleigh tip-mass model):

| Quantity | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| `k_eff = 3EI/L³` | 2.171×10⁵ N/m |
| `m_eff = m_tip + 0.23·m_mast` (m_mast = 22.1 g) | 180.1 g |
| `f1 = (1/2π)·√(k_eff/m_eff)` | **174.7 Hz** |

**Acceptance criterion:** `f1` must clear the **100 Hz control update rate** and a plausible low-hundreds-Hz motor/drivetrain excitation band by a factor of 2, i.e. **f1 ≥ 200 Hz**. **Result: 174.7 Hz → FAIL.** The lighter firmed tip mass raised the baseline f1 from 163.8 (0.20 kg placeholder) to 174.7 Hz, but it **still lands inside the 2× guard band** (clears 100 Hz at 1.7×), so the slender-tube baseline remains unacceptable. **Action: stiffen — shorter `L`, larger OD/wall, or a carbon tube — and re-check before accepting the mast.** This is exactly the kind of binding constraint the modal analysis (Section 6) is meant to catch.

> **This `3.1` hand calc is the analytical ground truth the Section 4 static FEA (and Section 6 modal) must reproduce within ~10–15% (away from stress concentrations) before the detailed-geometry FEA is trusted.**

### 3.2 Design revision — frequency fix (REQUIRED: the baseline FAILS modal)

The §3.1 baseline **passes strength but fails the modal guard band** (`f1 = 174.7 Hz < 200 Hz`, on the firmed 0.175 kg tip mass). A design sweep over mast geometry and material was run to find a configuration that clears `f1 ≥ 200 Hz` with comfortable margin while keeping the crash-case yield safety factor acceptable. Reproduce with `python experiments/mast_hand_calc.py`; raw output in `runs/mast_hand_calc/design_sweep.txt`.

**Sweep space:** length `L ∈ {0.12 … 0.08} m`, outer diameter `OD ∈ {16 … 25} mm`, wall `t ∈ {1.0, 1.5, 2.0} mm`, material ∈ {6061-T6 aluminum, CFRP}. For every candidate the sweep recomputes `f1 = (1/2π)·√(3EI/(L³·m_eff))` with `m_eff = m_tip + 0.23·m_mast`, and the **governing crash-case** stress/SF.

> **CFRP alternative (clearly-stated assumed properties):** a roll-wrapped/pultruded carbon-fiber tube, axial modulus depends strongly on layup (≈ 70–130 GPa); the sweep assumes **E = 100 GPa, ρ = 1600 kg/m³**. CFRP is **anisotropic with no single tensile yield**, so a "yield SF" is not strictly defined — it is screened only against a **conservative 600 MPa bending allowable** (well below ultimate ≈ 1.5–2 GPa). **Aluminum remains the recommended baseline** because its yield is well-defined; CFRP is the lighter upgrade path if mast mass ever becomes binding.

**Recommended revised mast:** **6061-T6 aluminum, L = 100 mm, OD = 20 mm, wall t = 1.5 mm (stock).** This uses **both** stiffness levers (modestly shorter `L`, larger `OD`), keeps the stock 1.5 mm wall and the well-defined-yield aluminum, and only trims `L` by 20 mm (preserving the LiDAR optical-center height / sightline over the compute stack) — most of the stiffness budget is spent on diameter.

| Quantity | **Baseline (FAILS)** | **Recommended (PASSES)** |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Geometry | L=120 mm, OD=16 mm, t=1.5 mm | **L=100 mm, OD=20 mm, t=1.5 mm** |
| Material | 6061-T6 Al | 6061-T6 Al |
| Section `I` | 1815 mm⁴ | **3754 mm⁴** (×2.07) |
| `k = 3EI/L³` | 2.17×10⁵ N/m | **7.76×10⁵ N/m** (×3.58) |
| **`f1` (Rayleigh, 0.175 kg tip)** | **174.7 Hz → FAIL** (< 200) | **330.1 Hz → PASS** (1.65× the 200 Hz guard; 3.3× the 100 Hz control rate) |
| Crash-case `σ` | 68.1 MPa | **34.3 MPa** |
| **Crash-case SF** vs yield | 4.05 (PASS) | **8.05 (PASS)** |
| Crash tip deflection | 0.593 mm | 0.166 mm |
| Mast self-mass | 22.1 g | 23.5 g (**+1.4 g**) |

**Why it works (stiffness rises far faster than mass).** Because the 0.175 kg tip mass dominates `m_eff` (mast self-mass ≈ 0.02 kg), `m_eff` is nearly constant and `f1 ≈ √(3EI/L³)`. The two levers attack `k = 3EI/L³` directly:
- **Shorter `L`:** `k ∝ L⁻³`, so 120→100 mm raises `k` by `(120/100)³ = 1.73×` (`f1 ∝ L⁻¹·⁵`) at essentially **zero mass cost**.
- **Larger `OD`:** for a thin wall `I ∝ OD³·t`, so 16→20 mm raises `I` by `2.07×`, while the extra material it adds to `m_eff` is second-order (tip mass dominates).

Together they lift `k` by `3.58×` and `f1` from 174.7 → 330.1 Hz. The same geometry change **also lowers** the crash stress (more `I` ⇒ less `M·c/I`), so the fix is **monotonic in both checks** — strength margin actually improves (SF 4.05 → 8.05). The same 100 mm/20 mm tube in CFRP would reach ≈ 400 Hz at ≈ 14 g, but aluminum is kept for its defined yield.

**Hand sanity-check of the recommended `f1`:** `I = π/64·(20⁴−17⁴) = 3754 mm⁴`; `k = 3·68.9e9·3.754e-9/0.1³ = 7.76×10⁵ N/m`; `m_eff = 0.175 + 0.23·0.0235 = 0.1804 kg`; `f1 = (1/2π)·√(7.76e5/0.1804) = 330.1 Hz`. ✔ matches the sweep.

> **FEA status — RE-RUN on the firmed 0.175 kg tip mass and VALIDATED.** The gmsh + CalculiX toolchain (gmsh 4.15.2 mesher in the conda `base` env; CalculiX 2.23 `ccx` solver in a conda `fea` env) was re-run on the **recommended** geometry with the firmed mass via `experiments/mast_fea.py`. **FEA agrees with the hand calc within ±15 %** on all three headline metrics, and the higher-fidelity **FE first frequency (285.5 Hz, up from 267.4 Hz at the old 0.20 kg placeholder) still clears the ≥ 200 Hz guard** (1.43×). Stand-up commands and the full workflow are in **`docs/design/FEA_SETUP.md`**; results in `runs/mast_fea/fea_summary.txt`. See §4 and §6.

## 4. Static FEA vs Hand Calc (REQUIRED)

> **DONE for the recommended geometry (§3.2), re-run on the firmed 0.175 kg tip mass.** Static FEA was run on the recommended mast (L=100 mm, OD=20 mm, t=1.5 mm, 6061-T6) with the **crash** load (**128.8 N** = 0.175 kg × 50 g × 1.5) and a fixed (ENCASTRE) root, via `experiments/mast_fea.py` (gmsh C3D10 mesh → CalculiX `ccx`). The crash load is **distributed over the tip-ring nodes** (a single-node point load creates a non-physical nodal singularity); stress is compared on a **mid-span gauge ring** (away from the fixed root and the load) where elementary `M·c/I` applies, plus the global tip deflection. Mesh: 58 232 nodes / 28 985 quadratic tets, element size ≈ 1.2 mm. Raw results in `runs/mast_fea/fea_summary.txt`; toolchain in `docs/design/FEA_SETUP.md`.

| Quantity | Hand calc | FEA | Δ% | Within ±15%? |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Tip deflection (crash) | 0.166 mm | 0.176 mm | +5.9% | **YES** |
| Mid-span gauge stress (crash) | 17.1 MPa | 17.4 MPa | +1.3% | **YES** |

> The fixed-root **peak** von Mises (41.9 MPa) is a re-entrant-corner stress concentration / mesh singularity, **not** a valid `M·c/I` comparison (root beam-theory `M·c/I` = 34.3 MPa) — which is exactly why the §5 mesh-convergence metric and the comparison above use a defined gauge region and the global deflection, not the peak nodal stress. Tip deflection (+5.9%) and gauge stress (+1.3%) both fall well inside the ±15% band, so the static hand calc is validated.

## 5. Mesh Convergence (REQUIRED, <5%)

> **DONE — PASS.** Three uniform refinements (~1.5× each) of the recommended mast, solved for the static crash case **and** the first bending mode via `python experiments/mast_fea.py --converge` (raw table: `runs/mast_fea/mesh_convergence.txt`). The gauge band is held **fixed** (z = L/2 ± 1.0 mm) across all levels so every mesh samples the same physical region — letting the band scale with element size would change the comparison region between levels and contaminate the convergence measure. Acceptance: <5% change in gauge stress (and tip deflection and f1) between the two finest meshes.

| Mesh level | Element size / count | Gauge stress | Δ% | Tip defl. | Δ% | f1 | Δ% |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Coarse | 3.0 mm / 4 747 C3D10 | 17.38 MPa | — | 0.1772 mm | — | 290.6 Hz | — |
| Medium | 2.0 mm / 10 435 C3D10 | 17.50 MPa | +0.70% | 0.1751 mm | −1.15% | 289.6 Hz | −0.35% |
| Fine | 1.2 mm / 28 985 C3D10 | 17.48 MPa | **−0.15%** | 0.1757 mm | **+0.30%** | 285.5 Hz | **−1.42%** |

All three metrics move by <1.5% at the final refinement — an order of magnitude inside the 5% acceptance band, so the 1.2 mm production mesh used in §4/§6 is converged for the quantities being reported. (The global *peak* von Mises at the fixed-root corner is deliberately **not** tracked here: it sits on a re-entrant-corner singularity and diverges with refinement, which is exactly why the acceptance metric is defined on the gauge region.)

## 6. Modal Analysis (REQUIRED, with acceptance criterion)

> **DONE for the recommended geometry (§3.2), re-run on the firmed 0.175 kg tip mass.** Acceptance criterion: `f1` must clear the **100 Hz control update rate** AND a plausible low-hundreds-Hz motor/drivetrain excitation band by **≥ 2× ⇒ f1 ≥ 200 Hz**. A CalculiX `*FREQUENCY` modal solve was run on the recommended mast with the **0.175 kg** LiDAR (Hokuyo UST-10LX, item 15) as a lumped `*MASS` element at the tip and a fixed root (`experiments/mast_fea.py`). **The baseline (174.7 Hz) FAILED this guard; the recommended geometry PASSES by both the hand calc (330.1 Hz) and the FEA (285.5 Hz).**

| Mode | Natural frequency (FEA) | Excitation source to clear | Margin | Pass? |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st (bending) | **285.5 Hz** (hand calc 330.1 Hz, Δ −13.5%) | 100 Hz control rate; low-hundreds-Hz motor band | **1.43× the 200 Hz guard; 2.86× the 100 Hz rate** | **YES** |
| 2nd (bending, orthogonal) | 301.3 Hz | — | — | — |
| 3rd | 1009.3 Hz | — | — | — |

> Modes 1–2 are the two ~degenerate orthogonal bending modes of the axisymmetric tube (the small 285→301 Hz split is mesh asymmetry). The FE `f1` lands ~14% below the Rayleigh hand calc because the closed-form model assumes a perfectly rigid root and pure Euler–Bernoulli bending (neglecting shear and root flexibility) and so slightly over-predicts stiffness — the expected direction and magnitude. **Even at the higher-fidelity 285.5 Hz the design clears the ≥ 200 Hz guard (1.43×)** — the lighter firmed LiDAR improved the FE margin from 1.34× (0.20 kg) to 1.43× — so the frequency fix is robust. Baseline-vs-recommended comparison and reasoning: §3.2.

### 6.1 Retrospective assessment — is the 200 Hz guard the right criterion? (audit F1)

> **Added 2026-09-25 by [the engineering audit](../ENGINEERING_AUDIT.md). This is a retrospective
> assessment of an existing threshold, not a recovery of the original reasoning, and it changes no
> criterion.** Reproduce: `python3 experiments/drivetrain_excitation.py`.

**Engineering question.** The guard is stated as: clear the 100 Hz control rate *and* "a plausible
low-hundreds-Hz motor/drivetrain excitation band" by 2×, hence `f1 ≥ 200 Hz`. The control-rate half is a
requirement and is satisfied. What frequency does this drivetrain actually produce?

**Inputs** — every one already derived elsewhere in this repository; none introduced here.

| Symbol | Value | Provenance | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `n_m` at 10 m/s | 20 600 rpm | calculated result | §14 §2 (1 744 rpm wheel × 11.82) |
| `n_0` no-load, 3S | 38 850 rpm | calculated result | §14 §2 (3 500 kV × 11.1 V) |
| `n_w` at 10 m/s | 1 744 rpm | calculated result | §14 §2 |
| `v_max` | 10 m/s | requirement | the speed §14's table is derived at |
| `f1` FEA | 285.5 Hz | calculated result | `runs/mast_fea/fea_summary.txt` |
| guard | 200 Hz | **selected value** | §3.1 — the number under assessment |

**Assumptions and validity limits.** First-order shaft frequency is `f = n/60`; that is exact. Whether
it *excites* the mast depends on rotor unbalance, the motor→chassis→deck→mast transmission path, and
damping. **None of those is recorded**, so this block bounds frequencies only, not amplitudes.

**Model.** `f_shaft(v) = (n_m/60)·(v/v_max)`, linear in road speed. The crossing speed at which shaft
order equals a target is `v_cross = v_max·f_target/(n_m/60)`.

**Substitution.**
`f_shaft(10) = (20 600/60)·1 = 343.3 Hz` · `f_shaft_no-load = 38 850/60 = 647.5 Hz` ·
`v_cross(285.5) = 10·285.5/343.3 = 8.32 m/s` · `v_cross(200) = 10·200/343.3 = 5.83 m/s`

**Unit check.** rpm ÷ 60 → rev/s = Hz. `v_max·Hz/Hz` → m/s. Both consistent.

**Result.**

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| First-order shaft at 10 m/s | **343.3 Hz**, i.e. **1.20× above** the 285.5 Hz mode |
| Wheel order at 10 m/s | 29.1 Hz |
| Road speed where shaft order meets the FEA mode | **8.32 m/s** |
| Road speed where shaft order crosses the 200 Hz guard | **5.83 m/s** |

**Sensitivity.** All of it scales linearly with road speed, so the conclusion is not sensitive to a
small speed error. It *is* sensitive to `f1`: at the 330.1 Hz hand value the crossing moves to 9.6 m/s,
still inside the envelope.

**What this shows.** The guard was justified as clearing an excitation band *upward* by 2×. This
drivetrain's first-order shaft excitation sits **above** the mast mode at speed and **sweeps up through
it at about 8.3 m/s**, inside the operating envelope. The reported "1.43× margin over 200 Hz" is a
margin against a number that does not describe this drivetrain.

**What this does not show.** That the mast is inadequate. A resonance swept through with low unbalance
and ordinary damping may be entirely harmless. **No amplitude claim is made or implied.**

**Decision.** None taken here. The criterion stands unchanged pending the missing inputs below.

**Validation / next inputs.** Status: **unresolved**. Required before this becomes an excitation
assessment rather than a frequency comparison:

| Missing input | Unlocks | How |
|---|---|---|
| Motor pole pairs | commutation-order frequencies | datasheet, or count stator teeth and magnets |
| Spur / pinion tooth counts | gear-mesh frequency | the part numbers already in §14's BOM |
| Rotor unbalance class | whether first order carries energy | vendor spec, or a bench run |
| Motor→deck transmission | mast-base input amplitude | bench measurement only; not calculable |

Two honest routes once those exist: re-derive the guard from a real excitation spectrum, or restate it
as a control-rate guard and record the drivetrain question as open. Widening the band to make the
present design pass is not one of them.

## 7. Tolerance Stack → LiDAR Angular Error (REQUIRED)

> **DONE — with a derived install requirement AND a derived deck-height requirement (updated 2026-07-07 for the chassis lock).** `experiments/mast_tolerance_stack.py` (raw: `runs/mast_tolerance_stack/summary.txt`). The UST-10LX scans a horizontal plane, so yaw misalignment is nulled by the software mount calibration; the physical stack that matters is the **tilt** of the scan plane. The requirement is derived from the sightline, both directions, at the 10 m guaranteed range (optical center **0.220 m** above floor = 0.100 m mast [LOCKED] + **0.120 m deck [ASSUMED, chassis-informed]**; wall 0.30 m [ASSUMED, conservative vs the common 0.33 m duct]): **governing bound = up-tilt wall clearance, θ ≤ 0.458°** (down-tilt floor-graze bound 1.260°).
>
> **Why the deck height changed:** the original run assumed 0.070 m deck-above-floor. The item-14 platform lock made that checkable — the Slash 4x4's skid-plate clearance alone is 0.072 m [vendor spec] and the deck rides on standoffs above the chassis rails — so 0.070 m was **physically infeasible** and the stack was re-run at a chassis-informed 0.120 m estimate. The earlier ">2× margin" claim did not survive this correction (see below).

| Contributor | Tolerance | Angular contribution | Note |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| Deck local flatness (20 mm base seat) | 0.10 mm / 20 mm | 0.286° | ASSUMED, machined/FR4-plate class |
| Mast base-to-tube squareness | — | 0.500° | ASSUMED FDM-bracket class, no post-machining |
| Bolted-joint preload rocking | — | 0.100° | clearance goes to yaw (software-nulled); tilt allowance kept |
| LiDAR internal scan-plane-to-base | — | 0.250° | ASSUMED — datasheet does not spec it |
| LiDAR mounting datum | 0.10 mm / 40 mm | 0.143° | ASSUMED bolt-pattern flatness |
| Elastic tilt @ 2g maneuvering | FEA-derived | 0.004° | negligible — stack is interface-dominated |
| **Worst-case sum (blind assembly)** | — | **1.284°** | **FAIL** vs 0.458° |
| **RSS (blind assembly)** | — | **0.652°** | **FAIL** vs 0.458° — at the realistic deck height even the RSS blind build is out |
| **Worst-case after scan-plane leveling** | — | **0.354°** | **PASS**, 1.29× margin at the 0.120 m deck estimate |

Beam-height error: ±5.7 cm (RSS, blind) / ±3.1 cm (calibrated worst) at 5 m; ±11.4 / ±6.2 cm at 10 m.

**Margin is deck-height-dependent (sensitivity in the run output):** the up-tilt bound tightens as the deck rises — 2.10× margin at 0.070 m (old, infeasible), 1.29× at the 0.120 m baseline, 1.00× at 0.138 m, FAIL by 0.150 m. Hence:

**Derived requirement 1 (install):** blind assembly fails worst-case *and* RSS, so the build gains a one-time **scan-plane leveling step** — shim the mast base, verify by scanning a wall at two distances and equalizing return heights. That nulls every contributor external to the LiDAR.

**Derived requirement 2 (CAD, new 2026-07-07):** the deck (mast-root) plane must sit **≤ 0.138 m above the floor** for the calibrated residual to clear the 0.30 m-wall bound (a 2× margin would need ≤ 0.076 m — infeasible below the 0.072 m skid plate, so 2× is not claimed). At the common 0.33 m wall the limit relaxes to 0.168 m. **This is a hard input to the item-16 deck CAD**, alongside the R-14 transponder bay. If the CAD cannot hold 0.138 m, the recorded fallbacks are: justify the wall height at 0.33 m for the target venue, or shorten the standoffs — the mast length L is *not* an available lever (locked by the ≥ 200 Hz modal guard, §3.2).

This is the same pattern as the §3.2 frequency fix: the analysis exists to catch the failure and convert it into a cheap requirement before anything is built.
